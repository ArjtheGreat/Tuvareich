 TAN_news.1.t:0 "10 Years since the Nuclear Fire"
 TAN_news.1.d:0 "Today marks the 10th year anniversary of the beginning of what has been called by some nations 'The Nuclear Fire'. After the war ground to a halt, with the Allies' attempted D-Day failing and being stopped just shy of Paris, Hitler saw the slow collapse of his lines, and felt he had to do something. So then every nation began a new Atomic Race, trying to pile up as many nuclear weapons as they could. Then on this fateful day, a large bomber was seen headed towards Berlin, and Hitler ordered all of the bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons to launch with them, determined to bring the entirety of Europe down with him. The Japanese also saw this opportunity and annihilated most of North America with their bombers, along with the East Coast of Asia. What had started could not be stopped by anyone, and the Allies and Comintern had to react in some way. So thus was North America and Europe turned to irradiated ashes, with only a few nations here and there able to escape the blasts."

 TAN_MEX.1.d:0 "We have now managed to reclaim our former capital, and there is much rejoicing within population for this fact. But despite their happiness at this, the city is still destroyed and partially irradiated, people needing to wear gas masks to avoid breathing in the partially toxic air. In spite of these dangers, people are suggesting we should move our capital, so that we can inspire confidence in our peoples."
 TAN_MEX.1.a:0 "Mexico City shall become our capital again!"
