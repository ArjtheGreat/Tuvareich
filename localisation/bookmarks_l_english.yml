 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."

 TITANS_OF_ASIA_NAME:0 "Titans of Asia"
 TITANS_OF_ASIA_DESC:0 "The Heartlands of the Asian continent are now one of the major remaining powers of the world, split between the new Comintern, India and its Muslim breakaways, and China, still divided and clashing among itself."
 THE_FORGOTTEN_CONTINENTS_NAME:0 "The Forgotten Continents"
 THE_FORGOTTEN_CONTINENTS_DESC:0 "Throughout history Africa and South America have been vastly ignored by the global powers. For once, 10 years ago, this worked out in the two continent's favor, as they were mostly spared from the nuclear blast. Though the instability from the world's collapse still echoes through the corners of these continents, they are thankful they were not mercilessly destroyed by the nuclear fire."

 PRU_THE_FORGOTTEN_CONTINENTS_DESC:0 "After the world collapse Peru was split due to infighting, and during these years Ecuador reclaimed Pastaza and took it as their own. Now that Peru has finally unified, many are saying that their government should do something about it."
 ECU_THE_FORGOTTEN_CONTINENTS_DESC:0 "As Peruvians celebrated the seizing of Pastaza, chaos swept over Ecuador, the government collapsing into chaos until General Jose managed to take control in a coup, creating the Ecuadorian Junta. Under his rule Ecuador became a more and more militarized state, to make sure that no one would ever be able to take their rightful lands again. In 1954, they managed to retake Pastaza with a small but extremely skilled army, rolling over the shocked and divided Peruvians, and only pressure from Brazil kept Ecuador from advancing further. But they still wait, eager to use their skilled military to dominate all their enemies."

 TAN_TITANS_OF_ASIA_DESC:0 "After the fall of the Western Soviet Union to nuclear fire, a few leaders managed to flee to Tannu Tuva, declaring them the heirs of the Soviet Union and claiming leadership of the Comintern. After half a decade they were shoved out of office due to corruption and pushing too hard against the people's wishes, but Tannu Tuva still managed to maintain control of the Comintern, even as the new Soviet Union started getting back up on its feet."
